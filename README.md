# Vector and Matrix Math

## Description

Implement various vector and matrix math functions using no math libraries.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* List comprehensions
* Introductory linear algebra concepts
* Raising exceptions

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Perform mathematical operations on complex list structures

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called vectors-and-matrices containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * a module called `matrix_math`
  * tests for `matrix_math`

### Requirements

* Passing unit tests
* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors
* No use of third-party libraries - only built in `+ - / *` operators and the `math` module
* **No use of `for` or `while` loops**

## Normal Mode

Implement these linear algebra functions:

* vector addition and subtraction
* vector multiplication by a scalar
* mean of multiple vectors
* dot product
* magnitude
* matrix addition and subtraction
* matrix multiplication by a scalar
* matrix multiplication by a vector
* matrix multiplication by a matrix

These functions are all defined in [the formulas notebook](Formulas.ipynb) included with this assignment as well as the [tests](test_matrix_math.py).

These functions must:

* Check the shape of the incoming vector or matrix before any calculations
* Reuse any duplicated code
